                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>Lil Homes was a company that built modular tiny houses.</p>
                    <p>Their clients were third parties that decorated homes to match their buyers needs.</p>
                    <p>One day a client called saying that they wanted to stop buying as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>He complained that the homes were not small enough and that could impact his manufacturing.</p>
                    <p>The brand new management team had barely any context on the subject.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <p>First of all, I read their guidelines to try to understand what were they referring to as “not small enough”.</p>
                    <p>We need concrete evidence of what our products were doing wrong.</p>
                    <p>After our first analysis, everything seemed up to standards. The homes were in fact built within the authorized dimensions.</p>
                    <p>To understand why they got that impression I searched the web for our product branding.</p>
                    <p>Quickly I found out a lot of misleading and obsolete advertisements on each of the Lil Home’s microsites.</p>
                
                    <div class="missing-img">
                        <p>Images are private and will only be displayed under personal supervision.</small>
                    </div>
                    <small class="missing-img-label"><b>Fig.1</b> - A picture of the website content analysis</small>

                    <p>I took notes of all the key points in our microsites.</p>
                    <p>I identified the owners of each microsite in our company, in case we’d have to delegate some tasks and needed to act fast.</p>
                    <p>I asked around trying to understand the motivations behind the advertisement.</p>
                    <p>After one day of talking to people from development to marketing, I concluded that the problem was a branding issue.</p>
                    <p>With sufficient context gathered I defined a two-phased action plan:</p>

                    <div class="missing-img">
                        <p>Images are private and will only be displayed under personal supervision.</small>
                    </div>
                    <small class="missing-img-label"><b>Fig.2</b> - A picture of the action plan</small>

                    <p>A short term solution that allowed us to act fast if the client would stop buying from Lil Homes.</p>
                    <p>A medium-term solution to avoid such a misunderstanding happening again.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Outcome</h2>
                    <p>At the end the advertisement and branding image were updated.</p>
                    <p>We never got any answer from our client and they did not break contract with us.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Learnings</h2>
                    <p>When time is short we do not have the luxury to prepare a proper research method.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes we need to acknowledge that any type of research is still research.</p>
                    <p>What’s most important is to know what to do and when to do it.</p>
