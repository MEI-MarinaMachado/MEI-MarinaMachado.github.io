                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>I was working for a greengrocer called Green Apples that sold apples.</p>
                    <p>They wanted to reach the small retailers among whom oranges were a success.</p>
                    <p>They had no customer contacts and did not know what they liked about oranges - was it the taste, size, or color?</p>
                    <p>Green Apples invested in creating a small farm and started selling oranges to get ahead.</p>
                    <p>Yet the farm had no pesticides so the production had a bug infestation problem.</p>
                    <p>At the time of the research team was made of me and the Product Owner.</p>
                </section>

                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <p>To begin we defined an Opportunity Solution Tree to help us:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>define the project goals,</li>
                        <li>find the goals opportunities (in other words problems or improvements),</li>
                        <li>invent experiments to achieve those goals.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We interviewed stakeholders, researched documentation and the current company’s OKR.</p>
                    <p>After some iterations we got our tree:</p>

                    <div class="missing-img">
                        <img src="src/img/illustrations/missing.png" alt="Missing image">
                        <p>Images are private and will only be displayed under personal supervision.</small>
                    </div>
                    <small class="missing-img-label"><b>Fig.1</b> - A picture of the Opportunity Solution Tree diagram</small>

                    <p>I created a survey to get a better understanding of the problem.</p>
                    <p>Although we should avoid open-ended questions on surveys, I decided to take the risk.</p>
                    <p>I wanted to see if there was any opportunity we may have missed in our initial research.</p>
                    <p>Also, I added a non-mandatory field to obtain the participants contact data.</p>

                    <div class="missing-img">
                        <img src="src/img/illustrations/missing.png" alt="Missing image">
                        <p>Images are private and will only be displayed under personal supervision.</small>
                    </div>
                    <small class="missing-img-label"><b>Fig.2</b> - A picture of an Interview Snapshot</small>

                    <p>It worked out really well.</p>
                    ​<p>Still, the written responses were not enough to understand the full context and motivation.</p>
                    <p>With the contacts I gathered I started doing interviews to dig in the survey’s results.</p>
                    
                    <div class="missing-img">
                        <img src="src/img/illustrations/missing.png" alt="Missing image">
                        <p>Images are private and will only be displayed under personal supervision.</small>
                    </div>
                    <small class="missing-img-label"><b>Fig.2</b> - A screenshot of the forum post for the survey announcement</small>
                    
                    <p>During all the process I worked on an Affinity Map.</p>
                    <p>I started by clustering the notes into groups we assumed existed based on the Opportunity Solution Tree.</p>
                    <p>With the survey’s answers and interview notes I tried to fill in the groups with more items.</p>
                    <p>Eventually, some groups disappeared and new ones showed up.</p>
                    <p>At the end the conclusions were clear.</p>
                    
                    <div class="missing-img">
                        <img src="src/img/illustrations/missing.png" alt="Missing image">
                        <p>Images are private and will only be displayed under personal supervision.</small>
                    </div>
                    <small class="missing-img-label"><b>Fig.3</b> - A picture of the Affinity Map</small>

                    <h2>Outcome</h2>
                    <p>The research proved that the solution we had was heading in the right direction.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, I discovered that we had some missing opportunities that affected our roadmap.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users did not mind most bugs, only the crickets were a problem. We kept the farm and invested in cricket pesticide.</li>
                        <li>Users wanted oranges but they also wanted orange juice.  We updated our discovery timeline to do additional research on the subject.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Learnings</h2>
                    <p>At the beginning I did a lot of data analysis.</p>
                    <p>I had a lot of pressure to provide the right direction and management always loves numbers.</p>
                    <p>Sadly, the analysis was getting nowhere no matter how you queried the data.</p>
                    <p>Next time, I will negotiate with management to postpone the data analysis or time box it.</p>
